# Hardware acceptance

Native probe-rs code is compiled and its target, address, sector, confirmation,
and error behavior is tested without hardware. A release that claims verified
device support must also complete this checklist on representative hardware.

## Preconditions

- Use a disposable or recoverable target with a known-good debug connection.
- Back up flash outside the image range when practical.
- Record the exact target name, probe selector, board revision, supply voltage,
  probe-rs version, and firmware SHA-256.
- Use a test image that emits an observable serial or GPIO result after reset.

## Acceptance flow

1. Run `doctor` and `probes list`; verify the intended probe has a unique serial.
2. Plan a small raw BIN inside boot flash and inspect `ranges`, `erase_ranges`,
   target, probe, policy, and digest.
3. Attempt execution with an incorrect digest; verify no device write occurs.
4. Execute with the exact digest and persist evidence to a new path.
5. Verify the image starts, the evidence reports read-back success, and the
   final core state is running or explains an immediate halt.
6. Read back bytes in the affected sectors but outside the image; confirm they
   were preserved.
7. Repeat with an image that crosses a sector boundary.
8. Unplug or deny access to the probe and verify structured unavailable or
   permission errors.
9. Attempt an option-byte/OTP address and a RAM address; both must be rejected
   before attach.
10. Inspect the evidence by CLI and verify its recorded plan digest and ordered
    operations match the run.

## Current result

Not run for this milestone: no debug probe was connected to the development
machine. This is an explicit release limitation, not an inferred success.

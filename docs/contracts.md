# Public contract v1

## Result envelope

Successful commands return one JSON object on stdout when `--json` is set:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "ok": true,
  "operation": "flash.plan",
  "operation_id": "op_<uuid>",
  "data": {},
  "warnings": [],
  "artifacts": []
}
```

Runtime failures use the same outer identity and a stable error code:

```json
{
  "schema_version": "1.0",
  "ok": false,
  "operation": "flash.execute",
  "operation_id": "op_<uuid>",
  "error": {
    "code": "CONFIRMATION_MISMATCH",
    "message": "flash confirmation digest does not match the current plan",
    "retryable": false,
    "details": {},
    "suggested_actions": []
  }
}
```

Diagnostic logs belong on stderr. A command never mixes a human preamble into
JSON stdout.

`doctor` reports capabilities compiled into this binary separately from
optional external executables. Native probe-rs discovery and guarded flashing
do not require the standalone `probe-rs` CLI to be installed.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
| ---: | --- |
| 0 | Success |
| 2 | Safety guard denied the operation |
| 3 | Verification or assertion failed |
| 4 | Probe or target unavailable |
| 5 | Timeout |
| 6 | Backend protocol failure |
| 7 | Configuration, fixture, or input error |
| 8 | OS or transport permission denied |
| 10 | Internal invariant or I/O failure |

## Addresses and bytes

Addresses are JSON strings such as `"0x08000000"`, avoiding precision loss in
JavaScript clients. Firmware and artifact content is identified with lowercase
SHA-256 hex strings. Large binary content will be returned as bounded artifact
references rather than unbounded inline data.

The current contract accepts raw `.bin` firmware. A probe-rs plan requires an
explicit `--base-address`; Replay takes its address and erase impact from the
fixture. A plan exposes:

- `firmware.base_address`: the first byte to program.
- `ranges`: exact bytes supplied by the image.
- `erase_ranges`: complete sectors affected by programming.
- `policy`: erase mode, preservation, verification, and post-flash behavior.
- `confirm_digest`: SHA-256 over backend, probe, target, firmware, both range
  sets, and policy.

The probe-rs workflow limits raw BIN data to readable boot NVM. It does not
grant the probe-rs full-chip erase permission. `preserve_unwritten_bytes=true`
means bytes in an affected sector but outside `ranges` are read and restored.
Mutation plans also require a non-empty probe hardware serial number; a VID/PID
selector alone is not accepted as stable device identity.

## Snapshot and evidence semantics

`core.captured_state` is the state while PC/SP/registers were read. `core.state`
is the state after capture is complete. The guarded flash workflow normally
reports `captured_state="halted"` and `state="running"`.

Evidence is reserved before opening hardware and published without overwriting
an existing path. `complete=true` means program, verify, reset, snapshot,
resume, and session disconnect all completed. New evidence includes the plan
identity, confirmation digest, write/erase ranges, policy, flash report, and
ordered operations.

ELF and HEX segment parsing are not yet part of this contract.

## Compatibility

Readers must reject unsupported major schema versions. New optional fields may
be added within the `1.x` line. Existing field meaning, error code meaning, and
risk classification cannot change within the major version.
